## Overview
The **Ishwardi Blood Donor Club Android App** is designed to streamline the process of connecting blood donors with those in need of blood in the Ishwardi community. As the app's developer, my goal was to create an accessible, efficient platform that promotes voluntary blood donation and provides timely access to life-saving resources.

This app allows users to register as blood donors, search for available donors, receive real-time notifications, mark themselves as available for emergency blood donations, and directly contact donors.

## Features
- **Donor Registration**: Users can easily sign up as blood donors by providing their contact details, blood type, and availability.
- **Search for Donors**: Users can search for available blood donors by blood type, ensuring quick and accurate connections.
- **Emergency Blood Requests**: Donors can opt to mark themselves as available in emergency situations, ensuring urgent needs are met promptly.
- **Real-time Notifications**: The app sends notifications to users about new blood donation requests in their area, helping them stay informed and ready to respond.
- **Direct Contact to Donor**: Users can directly contact the donor they find in the app, making communication seamless and efficient.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **IDE**: Android Studio
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Real-Time Database)
- **Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
- **UI**: XML for front-end development

## How It Works
1. **Donor Registration**: Blood donors can sign up using their phone number, blood group, and other contact information. This data is stored securely in Firebase.
2. **Search Functionality**: Users can search for donors based on blood type. The app displays a list of available donors to help users find the right match.
3. **Emergency Alert System**: Donors can mark themselves as available during an emergency. The app sends out alerts to nearby users, ensuring a fast response when urgent help is needed.
4. **Notifications**: The app sends notifications when new blood donation requests are posted, ensuring users are always informed.
5. **Direct Contact**: Users can contact the donors they find in the app directly through the provided contact details.

## Challenges Overcome
